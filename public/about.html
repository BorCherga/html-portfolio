<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Boryana Cherganova — a visual artist and journalist drawn to the hidden architecture of memory.<br/>
My creative practice bridges my background in storytelling and my deep fascination with how places, both real and imagined,<br/>
shape who we are.
</p>

<p>I began my career as a journalist in my home country - Bulgaria, capturing human stories, and changing lives through telling them to the world,<br/>
but painting gave me a new way to express myself and reach human heart and mind — one that uses color, form, and texture and reveals what words cannot.<br/>
Each piece I create is a layered dreamscape: a blend of structure and erosion, light and shadow, memory and transformation.<br/>
My work explores emotional landscapes through architectural compositions — bridges, arches, broken façades — forms that carry personal histories and collective echoes.<br/>
I am drawn to the liminal spaces between real, remembered, and imagined places, between what we see and what we feel.

Inspired by my encounters while travelling, cultural intersections, and my own inner terrain, I use mixed media and expressive brushwork to build visual poems — quiet reflections on time, displacement, and belonging.
I believe art should hold space for contemplation. A painting doesn't need to explain itself — it only needs to resonate. If my work opens a door to your own story or memory, then it has done its work.</p>
